This plugin allows the simplification of repetitive code fragments, allowing
much faster entry; for example, this text
        getset  List<String>  names

gets converted to
        public List<String> getNames()
        {
                return m_names;
        }

        public void setNames( List<String> val )
        {
                m_names = val;
        }

More importantly, it figures out when you're defining a boolean variable and
replaces the "get" with "is"; thus,
        getset  boolean  old enough

becomes
        public boolean isOldEnough()
        {
                return m_oldEnough;
        }

        public void setOldEnough( boolean val )
        {
                m_oldEnough = val;
        }

Observe how "old enough" was automatically camel-cased to "oldEnough", and,
when used with "get" or "is", was also capitalized. The same variable can be
used over and over again, each time with (if desired) different formatting
directives; for example, this template pattern
        My name is {john::f_fName} and my full name is {{fName} smith::uq_fullName}.

gets expanded to
        My name is John and my full name is "JOHN SMITH".

Observe, also, how the "fullName" directive recursively contained and expanded
the fName directive.
